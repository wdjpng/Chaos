# Chaos - The logistic map
A jupyter notebook implementing and explaining the logistic map

# Usage
The jupyter notebook can be directly accessed on Google colab using [this](https://colab.research.google.com/github/wdjpng/chaos/blob/main/main.ipynb) link

If, however, you want to edit this repository locally, you can do so by cloning it, installing the required pip packages
```
git clone https://github.com/wdjpng/chaos/
pip install matplotlib numpy
```

Then you can install [Jupyer](https://jupyter.org/) and open the directory of the cloned repo with it.

Now you can create visualizations like this one for yourself!
